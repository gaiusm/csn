[Currently this repository is incomplete and will fail to build
and is a work in progress.]

This is a free software implementation of the Meiko CSN.  It is
implemented in user space using GNU threads and it is written in
Modula-2.

Not all of the Meiko CSN features are implemented, at present the
timeout facility only accepts values of 0 (polling) or MAX(CARDINAL)
infinity.  None of the asynchronous options are implemented either.

However the synchronous routines were simple to use and
lightweight.  This implementation also includes a 'mrun' program
written in Python3.  The 'mrun' program reads in a .par file and runs
the executibles on the required architecture machines.  This 'mrun'
program can be used without the csn, for example it would be very
useful when trying to debug a client server socket program.

This package requires GNU Modula-2, Python3, pexpect and swig to build.
